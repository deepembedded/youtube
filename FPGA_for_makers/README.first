Hi.

The link to the video (FPGA for Makers, beginners, and SW Developers) is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BTk8dgzejw&t=9s
In the directory containing the file you are readin now, you will find a directory containing files for the Terasic DE0 board. In it, you will find the file 'divider.sv'
which contains the SystemVerilog code for the divider demostration. If you wish to just go ahead and "burn" a DE0 board that you have, you can open the project in Quartus II and go ahead.

Thanks.
